# ECE-231 Digital Logic Design
* 2023 Fall

## Hardware Requirements

Ideally you will install tools on your laptop, but if you have a problem (Mac?) then all tools are available on lab computers
that can be remotely accessed via web if necessary.

You are expected to use real tools

* Oscilloscopes/logic analyzers in the lab
* Verilog (can be installed on your laptop, runs in the lab)
* A CAD package
  * [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/download/) is extremely easy.
    It is free, but they ask for money on the main site. We will try to have an easy download available for Window/Mac.
    On Ubuntu Linux: sudo apt install fritzing
  * [Eagle](http://eagle.autodesk.com/eagle/software-versions/7) Free but bought by AutoCAD, increasingly money-grubby
  * [KiCAD](https://www.kicad.org/download/)
  * Cadence is the industry leader, hardest to use and quite expensive. Rutgers has a license
* Verilog, a language for defining logic circuits and generating large systems on an FPGA (Field Programmable Grid Array)
  * [Vivado](https://www.xilinx.com/support/download.html) is the industry leader. Their installer is horrible and requires a gigantic amount (60Gb+) of disk space. If you can, do it, but it is installed on machines in the computer labs. Everyone using Vivado has the same comment: it's awful, but it's the industry standard, so even though there are alternatives, you should have it and know it.
  * We will use vivado in this course to build some circuits for homework that build on your labs. You can build a 4-bit adder, but you cannot build a 64-bit real adder for a computer, you don't have the time or a board big enough. But in Vivado, that's easy.
* [LTSpice](https://www.analog.com/en/design-center/design-tools-and-calculators/ltspice-simulator.html) A tool for analog circuit analysis can also be used to draw circuits, and is something you should have in your toolbox, but is not required.

## COURSE DESCRIPTION

This course covers digital logic design

* Introduction to DLD, logic circuit hardware and software implementation examples.
* Number systems and binary arithmetic.
* Analysis and synthesis of combinational circuits, Karnaugh maps, timing hazards.
* Encoders, decoders, multiplexers, demultiplexers.
* Arithmetic systems, comparators, adders, multipliers.
* Sequential circuits, latches, flip-flops.
* Registers, shift registers, counters, LFSRs.
* Analysis and synthesis of finite state machines.
* Use of verilog to build larger circuits and test them virtually.

## Course Outcomes

After completion of this course, students will be able to
*  Design simple logic circuits to solve design problems.
* 
*  Use industry standard tools (Vivado)

## FORMAT AND STRUCTURE
* Classes include slides and live coding. You are encouraged to actively participate.

## COURSE MATERIALS

The textbook is: J. F. Wakerly, Digital Design Principles and Practices, 5th ed., Pearson, ISBN-13: 9780134460093.

* All materials for this course are in the course repository: https://github.com/RU-ECE/ECE231-DigitalLogicDesign
* Reference materials are available in the [ref directory]()
* Other Readings: 	Papers will be added to ref directory of repo

## COURSE REQUIREMENTS
* **Attendance:**	Attendance is crucial for an effective learning but will not be graded. Your work will speak for itself.
* **Homework:** 	Coding assignments will be submitted via canvas for individual single files, or via github.

## GRADING PROCEDURES
Grades will be based on:
* Labs                                                (15%)
* Homeworks                                           ( 5%)
* Group Homeworks                                     ( 5%)
* Test 1                                              (20%)
* Test 1                                              (20%)
* Final Project or final exam                         (35%)
* In class quizzes may be given for practice (no pressure)

Final Projects are only available to students doing very well who have demonstrated interest in going beyond.
If a final project is not sufficient to replace the final, you may be told to take the final anyway.
