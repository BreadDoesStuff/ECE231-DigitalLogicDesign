FAQ:

1. What software do I have to load?
   A. A CAD package (start with fritzing, circuitlab, or tinkerCAD)
   B. Icarus Verilog (you have a week)
   C. Other ones as you find them useful. Watch me use them....

2. Readings
   A. You can read up in Wakerly about gates or...
   B. Watch a tutorial on youtube
   C. NOT, AND, OR, XOR, NAND, NOR,
   D. identities, DeMorgan's Laws

3. VIdeo about basic V=IR and safety

1. Joule
10 J = 1 liter bottle raised 1m in earth gravity

car: 1000kg = 1 metric ton 
60mph = 30m/s

E = 1/2mv^2 = 1/2(1000)30^2 = 450,000J 450kJ

tank shell
m=10kg
V = 2000m/s
//https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xONZcBJh5A&t=10s
E = 1/2(10)(2000^2) = 20,000,000 = 20MJ


V = 1000V
C = 5F

E = 1/2CV^2 
E = 1/2LI^2



V=IR = 5 = I (100)
I = V/R = 5/100 = .05A = 50 mA


V = IR
V = 5V
R = 0ohm
I = V/R = 5/0

P = IV = I^2R 


Assumptions for small signal, DC electricity
wires have no resistance (no voltage difference)
voltage changes are instantaneous
if current = 0, both sides of a resistor are the same voltage
