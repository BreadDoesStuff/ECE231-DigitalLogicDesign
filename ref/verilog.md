# Verilog Summary

Verilog

* Standardized as IEEE 1364
* a hardware description language (HDL)
* Used to model electronic systems
* C family language, a little similarity with Arduino/C++

* See [verilog standard](ref/verilog-std-1364-2005.pdf)
* See [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verilog)

Key terms
* Module - a function that has inputs and outputs
* Variable - A symbol that can have a value
  * Almost all variables in verilog have one of 4 values
    * 0
    * 1
    * x (unknown)
    * z (high impedence)
* Data type - [verilog data types](https://www.chipverify.com/verilog/verilog-data-types)
* Syntax - grammar of a programming language
  * Syntax of C langauges is complicated and redundant
  * There is more than one way to do many things in verilog
  * We will focus on best practices, not learning everything
  * Verilog quick references

### Identifiers

* A name for something in a program
* Named entities include
  * variables
