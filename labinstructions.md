# Lab Instructions

Good strategies will help you do better in labs. You need to be
efficient with your time, and use both members of your team to get as
much as possible done as quickly as possible.

1. Build large circuits in modules separate on the board.
1. Test each individual piece independently, don't try to test the whole thing.
1. Be neat.
   1. Color coding wire
   1. wires flat to the board (takes more time but on a big build will save debugging)
   1. chips oriented the same way will avoid mistakes
1. Both team members should build different parts
   1. on different areas of the board in parallel.
   1. Different boards
1. Learn to use test equipment early in the semester.
