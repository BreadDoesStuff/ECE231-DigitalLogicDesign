# Verilog

Verilog is a Hardware Description Language (HDL)

* Derived from C family
* uses ; to end lines {} to group
* IEEE Standard 1364

VHDL is another one (derived from Ada)

HDLs can be used for a number of purposes

* Design hardware and simulate it
* Program FPGA boards
    * Field Programmable Grid Array
    * FPGA are slower than pre-built circuits
    * FPGAs are popular on high end (RADAR)
    * low end (custom logic on traffic light)
    * Much lower power/compute ratio
* Custom ASIC - built in factory, faster

* Bespoke Processing/Processors

* RTL Register Transfer Language
*
