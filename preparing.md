# Preparing to Take Digital Logic Design

This course is the at the beginning of your journey to learn
Electrical/Computer Engineering skills. The following are a
list of tools you should install, starting with the ones we will
use in this course. Optional tools are listed so you know areas
that will help you grow, but which you do not have to immediately
work on.

* [fritzing](https://rutgersconnect-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/personal/dk1261_soe_rutgers_edu/Documents/ECE231-DigitalLogicDesign?csf=1&web=1&e=L5R9op) This is a baby CAD package, particularly advantageous because is shows you a view of a breadboard so you can virtually set up circuits even before you get to lab. You can go quite far with this, but it's good to learn a more industrial CAD package when you can.

* [arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) We are going to use Arduinos at the very least as convenient little power supplies to drive small digital projects, and I will offer a workshop on them for anyone who wants to learn. Please install the software, you will need it for at least one other class anyway.

* [verilog](https://rutgersconnect-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/personal/dk1261_soe_rutgers_edu/Documents/ECE231-DigitalLogicDesign?csf=1&web=1&e=L5R9op) Install vivado. This is a programming language that lets you define lots of gates. In lab, you will build with a few chips, using at most a dozen or so gates. With vivado, You can design a full computer, not that we are ready to do that just yet. I will be giving out homework using vivado, and if you have to, you can use lab computers, but having it on your computer is a good thing. Vivado is horrible, it takes hours to install, but it is industry standard, which I suppose means that all the other competitors are even more horrible. It's an important thing to learn and what it can do is amazing, so we have to put up with some of it's more disagreeable details.

=================================================
Below this are tools which are optional but recommended

* [github](https://education.github.com/pack) Create an account on github so you can create repositories. This is the way all modern programmers work in teams, and it's useful for any team of people who want to create a set of shared files, and may change those files without being in the same place. How do you work with other people, when you all want to edit the same files at the same time? There are no doubt tutorials on youtube, and I will offer one myself. See git below.

* [git]() Git is the software used by github, and must be installed on your computer. Here are my [instructions](), and I am happy to have a workshop to teach peoplep how to use this out of class for a group that wants to learn.

* [LTSpice](https://www.analog.com/en/design-center/design-tools-and-calculators/ltspice-simulator.html) This is a tool that creates simulations of circuits so you can see how they work in realtime. This is for analog signals, so it's more for other courses than this one. It actually would work as a CAD package for drawing schematics for this course, but it's not the best one.

* [Altium (free for students)](https://www.altium.com/education/student-licenses) Sign up for Altium through your Rutgers account and download and install the CAD package.

* [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) You will not need to use vscode for programming, but I will use it to type documents, it's a great editor, and you can join me in class typing on screen, so it is useful. I will be happy to offer a tutorial in this one to anyone who wants to learn out of class.
