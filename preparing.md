# Preparing to Take Digital Logic Design

This course is the at the beginning of your journey to learn
Electrical/Computer Engineering skills. The following are a
list of tools you should install, starting with the ones we will
use in this course. Optional tools are listed so you know areas
that will help you grow, but which you do not have to immediately
work on.

* [Directory containing all software](https://rutgers.box.com/s/fk46grwr38cpuoyu3o7thwbk2379cwo3) (some for windows and Mac)
* [fritzing for PC](https://rutgers.box.com/s/xzia4qlp5pu3kqhedi28mww8b1zkwgyx)
  [fritzing for Mac](https://rutgers.box.com/s/gvhypglldi0fq2cbpvcahmgwdjzzb417) This is a baby CAD package, particularly advantageous because is shows you a view of a breadboard so you can virtually set up circuits even before you get to lab. You can go quite far with this, but it's good to learn a more industrial CAD package when you can.

* [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/circuits)
This is roughly equivalent to fritzing but online. If you cannot install fritzing, you may use TinkerCAD instead.

* [verilog](https://bleyer.org/icarus/)
  We will be using Verilog, a programming language for designing digital hardware. Icarus is not the best one
  it's open source, and good enough for use in this course.

  =================================================
Below this are tools which are optional but recommended

* [verilog](https://rutgersconnect-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/personal/dk1261_soe_rutgers_edu/Documents/ECE231-DigitalLogicDesign?csf=1&web=1&e=L5R9op) You do not have to install vivado, but if you wish to, it will be used in other courses later. Xilinx Vivado is the industry leader. Despite that, it is horrible. It is huge (at least 65GB to install, 130GB if you aren't careful and install all the devices that it can support. It takes hours to install, but everyone tells me the other competitors are even more horrible. It's an important thing to learn and what it can do is amazing.

* [github](https://education.github.com/pack) Create an account on github so you can create repositories. This is the way all modern programmers work in teams, and it's useful for any team of people who want to create a set of shared files, and may change those files without being in the same place. How do you work with other people, when you all want to edit the same files at the same time? There are no doubt tutorials on youtube, and I will offer one myself. See git below.

* [git]() Git is the software used by github, used to work in a team of people on common documents. You will see me use git to store all new class materials.

* [LTSpice](https://www.analog.com/en/design-center/design-tools-and-calculators/ltspice-simulator.html) This is a tool that creates simulations of circuits so you can see how they work in realtime. This is for analog signals, so it's more for other courses than this one. It actually would work as a CAD package for drawing schematics for this course, but it's not the best one.

* [KiCAD] (https://www.kicad.org/download/)
  An open source CAD package that is substantially more advanced than Fritzing etc.
  
* [Altium (free for students)](https://www.altium.com/education/student-licenses) Sign up for Altium through your Rutgers account and download and install the CAD package. This is a real, sophisticated CAD package for designing circuits on a large scale.

* [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) You will not need to use vscode for programming, but I will use it to type documents, it's a great editor, and you can join me in class typing on screen, so it is useful. I will be happy to offer a tutorial in this one to anyone who wants to learn out of class.
